# GENERATED WITH SIMPLECONFIG BY MAGISTERMAKS

# This is a config file for the mod Forging Beyond.
# The value below is used by the mod to define at what XP level the anvil should block forging items together and display the message 'Too Expensive!'.
# The allowed range of values the mod allows is from 2 to 32767.
# If given value is outside of the range or is not a number, the mod will use value '40' instead!
# In case of joining a multiplayer server, this value will be ignored in favor of the server's configured value, or lack thereof.
